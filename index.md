# Luna's Collage
I wasn't really sure what I wanted to include here, so here is a list of 10 semi-random things about me! 

## Header 2

*   I was born in Queens, New York, and I moved around the NYC area for most of my childhood. 
*   I am also a citizen of Poland and spent my summers there with the rest of my family who lives there. 
*   I love to buy, cook, and talk about food. I am always excited for something food related so definitely feel free to ask me about anything food related :)
*

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
